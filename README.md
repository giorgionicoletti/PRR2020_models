The Python code contained in this repository was used for some of the simulations that we presented in https://journals.aps.org/prresearch/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevResearch.2.023144. In particular, the code reproduces the models of both Section III (a standard contact process) and Appendix B. Please note that the code for the contact process was written years ago and has not been optimized since.

If you use any part of the code, please cite:
